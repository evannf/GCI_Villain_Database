# GCI_Villain_Database

The GCI Villain Database is an Express app I created to catalogue some of the villains from my favoite show: The Venture Bros. The app has full CRUD functionality allowing users to create their own Guild ID page, edit current member information, or delete members from the database. I used a combination of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, EJS, Method_Override, and the database is setup through MongoDB Atlas.

User Stories:
  -A curious user should be able to open pages for each villain with more information by clicking on their name.
  -An aspiring Guild member should be able to register with their name, age, bio, arch rival, and a linked image.
  -As a publicly ran Guild, anyone should be able to edit or delete member information.

The app is currenlty hosted on Heroku:
